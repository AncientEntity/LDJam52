# Ecliptic Industries

This is the final product of the LDJam hackathon that took place from January 6th to January 9th, 2023. Inspired from Turmoil and our theme of Harvest.

## Premise
Capitalism can no longer be escaped in space. Your goal is to buy up a solar system, mine it for all itâ€™s precious materials, sell them for $$$, then repeat.

We recommend a minimum of 10 minutes to try out the game, in that time you can complete roughly 2 stages. One of our team members spent several hours balancing the game and the awesomeness really starts to get awesome around there.
