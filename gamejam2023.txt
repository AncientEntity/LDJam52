STORE:

-SELL:
	ORE (2 or 3 types??) 
		

-BUY:
	-Personillazation:
		-Cromas
		
	-Upgrades:
		-DRILLS (Solar eff, bits , speed)
			-lvl decreases cost for game
			-maybe solar eff can only be bought by cores. Late game improvement kinda thing
			-eff,speed,bits mines faster. somthin like this 0.7 * lvl + formula like 0.3 * eff + 0.5*speed + 0.4 * bits  = ammount per second
		-SHIP	
			-(upgrade ship to point to leave solar system)
			-Or use them for getting mats off planets too sell. 
	-Tools:
		-DRILLS
		-SHIP??
			-different ships??
		-Core extrxtion (upgrade unavalable until bit lvl 5 or somin)
			-(maybe different lvl planets, depending on lvl can extract core from that planet, higher level more cores??)
		-Some kind of dowsers to see what ore and ammount is avalable from planet??
	-Companions??
	-Planets (maybe bid on them)
-Money system:



Ideas:
	-need more things for shop
	-are we wanting to sell in the solar system or space station. 
		-if solar system. We can have ship upgrades and buy more ships. 
		Which can transport items faster, store more, more ships in each group
		more group exc. Exc like turmoils hourses. If you dont sell in time, could sell in shop for a cheaper price
		chance to get more during the mission. maybe random between 75 - 150 for iron, where space station sells for 
		100 kinda thing 
		-else, upgrade ships grabes faster more ships and that still. But if you dont grab all
		mats before end of time then you dont get all the mats before you loose on stuff you mined
	-need more things we can interact with planets with. 
		-Show planets core value, ore, ore ammount (maybe show all ore with ?? then use dowser to display)
	-some kind of gass or something with the sun to give a boost productivity. (throw nuke into sun?? Chance to explode?? or chance to boost sun)
	-dowser level. See lower down?? idk what upgrades would be
